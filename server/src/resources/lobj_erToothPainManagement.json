  "description": "Please note that these instructions have not yet been reviewed by a professional. Please send your suggestions to info@edehr.org\n\nThe teenage patient arrives at ER at 2am, accompanied by her parents, complaining of severe pain in her upper left back molar, which she states has worsened over the past 5 hours. Although the patient has an appointment to see her dentist later in the day, she presents with a request for urgent pain relief.  See the chart for further details, including medical history.\n\nThe attending physician is prescribing 8 doses of 1 mg hydromorphone. What questions do you have about the physician’s order? What further communication, and with whom, is warranted? What information will you give to the patient and her family?\n\nThis is an oral health issue so you may do some research and find the following resources.\n\nA paper called \"Prescribing and Dispensing Drugs\" https://portal.oralhealthbc.ca/CDSBCPublicLibrary/Prescribing-and-Dispensing-Drugs-Standard-and-Guideline.pdf on the website of the B.C. College of Oral Health Professionals says on page 5 that “over-prescribing of opioid pharmaceuticals by health care professionals is a problem.” Their guidelines suggest dentists question if there is a reasonable non-narcotic alternative to opioids. If they do prescribe opioids, they’re asked to consider the minimum dose and number for pain control in the immediate post-operative period. \n\nThe paper \"Trends in national opioid prescribing for dental procedures among patients enrolled in Medicaid\" (https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(21)00244-0/fulltext) says \"Although the trends revealed in the analysis show declining opioid prescription patterns, these results suggest that the overall rate is still too high and prescriptions are being written unnecessarily.\"\n\nAnother paper \"Pain Management: Part 1: Managing Acute and Postoperative Dental Pain\" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2886920/) says \"for decades studies have repeatedly found that NSAIDs are generally superior to opioids at conventional dosages\"\n\nThe pamphlet \"How to Manage Pain After a Dental Procedure Without Opioids\" (https://health.ri.gov/publications/instructions/ManagingPainAfterDentalSurgery.pdf) offers some suggestions.\n",
