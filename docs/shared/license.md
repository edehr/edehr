# Open Source & License

> A core requirement of this project is to be open source.

Open source means all the code and documentation is publicly available,
all the time, even while under development.

The [GNU Affero General Public License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) is a modified version of the 
ordinary [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/). It has one added requirement: 
if you run a modified program on a server and let other users communicate with it there, your server must also allow 
them to download the source code corresponding to the modified version running there.

The GNU Affero seems to best fit the intention of BCCampasâ€™s mandate to provide open source educational tools and promote 
the development of more open source tools.

Todo: Add a header to code files. Question: should the author's name be the developer or BCcampus?
