# Student users of the EdEHR

> Many student users have reported that working in the EdEHR is intuitive and relatively easy

## Getting Started

All access to the EdEHR is through your school's learning management system (LMS). You start by logging into your LMS and navigate to your course. You will see many activities to complete and some of these may launch the EdEHR with a case study for you to work with.

The main parts of your student's view of the EdEHR include

- Application menu banner
- EHR content

- Access documentation:  brings you to this page of the documentation.
- Return to your activity: brings you back to the EHR content pages.
- Submit your activity to your instructor: see below.
- Tools menu: see below

## Submit Activity

When you are ready to submit your work for evaluation by your instructor then use the ```Submit Activity``` button. 
When you do this your instructor can view and evaluate your work.
Once your work is "submitted" you can no longer make changes to the EHR content. 
Your instructor may also close off the activity for you or for the whole class. 
And they can also send the activity back to you so you can do more work.

When you submit your work the EdEHR will send you back to your LMS. (Same as if you use the ```Tools``` menu and  ```Exit to LMS```.)

## Student tools menu
The ```Tools``` menu lets you access information about the activity, 
see any evaluation comments your instructor may have left for you, 
work with a scratch pad for taking notes, and
to return back to your learning management system (LMS)

### Instructor's comments

Once you have submitted your work your instructor may provide evaluation comments. Use this menu item to view these comments.

### Activity information

Select Activity Information from the student ```Tools``` menu to see details about the current activity.

**Course** This is the name of the course from your LMS.

**Activity** This is the activity name that you see in your LMS.  If the LMS provided a description then this appears here too.

**Learning Object**.  This is the information entered into the EdEHR about the Learning Object.  This area shows the name and description. The description often contains the learning objectives for this activity.


### Scratch pad

You have a private scratch pad for taking notes as you work. The text you see here is visible only to you and is for this current activity.

### Exit to LMS

This is a link that takes you back to your LMS.  (It uses a URL that your LMS gave to the EdEHR when you clicked the link in your LMS.)
