# Student quide to the EdEHR

> Many student users have reported that working in the EdEHR is intuitive and relatively easy

## Getting Started

All access to the EdEHR is through your school's learning management system (LMS). You start by logging into your LMS and navigate to your course. If some activities are linked to an instance of the EdEHR then these will launch the EdEHR with a case study for you to work with.

![1]

The main parts of your student's view of the EdEHR include

- Application menu banner
- Learning activity banner
- Health record
  - banner
  - navigation
  - content

> For more information on the health record area please see the [Electronic health records](/ehr) sections of this documentation.


## Application banner

- ```Students guide``` brings you to this web page in the EdEHR documentation.
- ```Demonstration``` is ONLY visible when using the [Full Demonstration](/#full-demonstration-mode) mode. This button takes you to the demo home page.
- The ```Tools``` menu provides quick access to the student's tools (see below)
![2]


# Student tools menu
The ```Tools``` menu lets the student access their courses, the current activity, the student's scratch pad, and to return back to your learning management system (LMS). The tools menu is always available in the application banner.
![8]

### Tools menu: Courses

This link takes you to the [```dashboard```](/student/#dashboard) course listing page.

### Tools menu: Activity

This link takes you to the [```dashboard```](/student/#dashboard) current activity page.

### Tools menu: Scratch pad

Each student has a private scratch pad for taking notes while working within the EHR application. The text you see here is visible only to the student and each activity has its own scratch pad.  The student can also see the contents of their scratch pad on the activity page.

### Tools menu: Exit to LMS

This is a link that takes you back to your LMS.  Note that this link does not appear if your school is using D2L because D2L does not provide the necessary information.


## Learning activity banner

The region below the Application Banner is the Learning activity banner.  This area contains tools and information about the learning activity.

![3]
When you, as a student, begin working on an activity this banner will tell you the name of the activity and show 
the ```Submit``` button. You use this button when you are finished working on the assignment and are ready 
to submit your work for your instructor's evaluation. Once you submit you can no longer make any changes. 
So, the application asks you to confirm that you really are ready to make the submission.
![7]

Immediately after submission the application will show the student user their [```dashboard```](/student/#dashboard)

While you are working in the patient charts you may have incomplete reports. Any incomplete report is 
called a [draft](/ehr/#draft-reports-and-verifying-correctness) report and if there is one or more draft reports the submit button changes colour to warn you to finish these reports before submitting your work for evaluation.

![4]

After submission the learning activity banner shows the status as "closed for edits". Meaning the work is now in the hands of the instructor to evaluate the work. (Note that instructors may later send the work back to the student for further edits. In which case the Submit button will reappear.)

![5]

Once the instructor has evaluated the work and released these evaluation notes, the learning activity banner displays the instructor's feedback.

![6]

## Dashboard

This is your dashboard where you can access all your activities in one place.  This is also where you can read what your instructor has said about your work.

![9]

The main parts of the student's dashboard include

- Application menu banner (as above)
- Dashboard navigation
- Content area such as courses, course, activity, etc.

### Dashboard navigation

![10]

The dashboard navigation provides quick access to your courses, the currently selected course, and the currently selected activity. 

The ```exit to LMS``` link that takes you back to your LMS.  Note that this link does not appear if your school is using D2L because D2L does not provide the necessary information.


## Courses

The ```Courses``` page will list every course that you have used the EdEHR with.

![11]

Select a course by clicking on its name which is a link to the Course page.

## Course

The ```Course``` page displays course information.

![12]

The course title and description are in the top area while the bottom area presents a list of all the activities you have accessed (via your LMS).

Each activity displays its name, description, time stamp of when the activity was last touched and when it was created, and the current status of the activity (open for edits, closed for evaluation) and a button to select the activity and open it in the EHR application.

Click on an activity's name to select it and go to the Activity page

## Activity

The Activity page displays the activity name, description, the current status (open or submitted), a button to return to the health record application, any evaluation feedback from the instructor, the student's scratch notes, and the last time stamps for this activity.
