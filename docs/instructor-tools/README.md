# Instructor tools and navigation

Instructors and course content creators can navigate the learning management side of the EdEHR with either the sidebar navigation or the application banner's menu button.  Both present the same top level options.

## My activities

The ```All Courses``` link takes you to a page that lists all the courses that you are permitted access (i.e. you clicked on a link in your LMS for an activity within a course).

Select a course on the ALl Courses page. E.g. see the screenshot above where we have selected a course and an activity within the course

## Course

The ```Course``` page (appears as the Course title) displays the list of activities.  You can select from this list to work on a different activity.  

> From the Course page, instructors can control the [skills assessment mode](../instructor/#skills-assessment)

This activity page is where you can access the class list, the learning object, and the case study linked by the learning object. For more about this page see the [Instructor guide](../instructor/README.md)

## Learning objects

The ```Learning objects``` link takes you to the Learning Objects page. Here you can see every learning object in the instance of EdEHR.  For more about this page see [Learning objects](./learning-objects.md) 

## Case studies

The ```Case studies``` link takes you to the Case Studies page. Instructors can see all the case studies in the EdEHR instance. For more about this page see [Case studies](./case-studies.md)

## Files

This page allows content creators to store files to be used in case studies. For example, x-rays, MRI scans, lab reports, etc.

## LMS

This page provides information about your LMS as seen by the EdEHR.

## Exit to LMS

This menu item takes you, the user, back to your LMS.

## Hide button labels

This checkbox item toggles the display of labels in the buttons. With text hidden the display is more compact and more useful on smaller displays.
