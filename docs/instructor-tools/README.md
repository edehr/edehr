## Course designer mode

Instructors can self promote themselves to the role of "content creator".  With this role, users can create and manage Learning Objects and Case Studies. When you are a content creator you will see many more actions on the Learning Objects and Case Studies pages. To become a content creator check the ```Course designer mode``` checkbox either in the sidebar navigation or in the application banner's menu.

## My activities

The ```My activities``` link takes you to a page that lists all the courses and activities you have access too. Note that, you only have access to an activity if you have previously clicked on the activity in your LMS.  Having access to activities means you have access to the activity's class list and the student's work.  On the ```My activies``` page you can select any activity which means you do not need to return to the LMS to select a different activity.

## Activity

The ```Activity``` page shows information about the activity you have selected (either via a link in your LMS or via the ```My activities``` page).  This page shows the activity name and description which is the information provided by the LMS. This activity page is where you can access the class list, the learning object, and the case study linked by the learning object. For more about this page see the [Instructor guide](../instructor/README.md)

## Learning objects

The ```Learning objects``` link takes you to the Learning Objects page. Here you can see every learning object in the instance of EdEHR.  For more about this page see [Learning objects](./learning-objects.md) 

## Case studies

The ```Case studies``` link takes you to the Case Studies page. Instructors can see all the case studies in the EdEHR instance. For more about this page see [Case studies](./case-studies.md)

## Files

This page allows content creators to store files to be used in case studies. For example, x-rays, MRI scans, lab reports, etc.

## LMS

This page provides information about your LMS as seen by the EdEHR.

## Exit to LMS

This menu item takes you, the user, back to your LMS.

## Hide button labels

This checkbox item toggles the display of labels in the buttons. With text hidden the display is more compact and more useful on smaller displays.
