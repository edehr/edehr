# Introduction to the EdEHR
The EdEHR (**Ed**ucational **E**lectronic **H**ealth **R**ecord) is a platform for educational healthcare programs to base their teaching within simulated electronic health record system.  Visit [https://edehr.org](https://edehr.org) to learn more about the benefits of using the EdEHR in your healthcare education.


The EdEHR is a simulated electronic health record (EHR) or lab information system (LIS) that is designed for healthcare education. This web based application can present either as an EHR or LIS depending on the choice of the user who creates the educational content.  The LIS version is new and so many times this documentation will say "EHR", but you can read that as "EHR or LIS". 

The EdEHR is used by nursing and medical laboratory technology programs. It can be used for medical laboratory assistant training and for many other healthcare professions. 

The EdEHR is focused on the student experience. Each student has their own workspace separate from others, and instructors are able to both create course content (case studies) and review student's work.

The EdEHR works with any learning management systems (LMS) that is LTI compliant.  For example, 
[Moodle](https://moodle.org/),
[Canvas](https://www.canvaslms.com/),
[Blackboard](https://www.blackboard.com), and
[D2L](https://www.d2l.com/).

Most users of the EdEHR are either students or instructors. All users access the EdEHR via their LMS. The LMS provides user authentication and authorization. Two other important roles are the EdEHR administrator and the education institution's LMS administrator.

Instructors can interact with their students through the automatically managed class list. They can also self-promote themselves to the role of course content creator. This allows instructors to create and manage their healthcare educational content.

## Getting Started - How to explore the EdEHR

There are three ways to explore what the EdEHR is.
1. Using the "EHR only demonstration" mode available from the home page,
2. Using the "Full EdEHR demonstration" mode available from the home page, or
3. With an instance of EdEHR in combination with an LMS

### EHR only demonstration mode

If you are curious and want a quick peak at the EHR/LIS pages then go to [https://edehr.org](https://edehr.org) and select the "EHR only demonstration" button.  In this demonstration mode,
- You can explore some sample case studies from two courses. One course is for nursing (EHR) and the other is for med lab students (LIS).
- You can edit any case study (e.g. chart some medical assessment or otherwise use an EHR)
- You can save a copy of your edits (download). You can later import that file back into an instance of EdEHR and/or share it with a

### Full demonstration mode

The full demonstration lets you see how the EdEHR supports schools that use learning management systems (LMS).  Contact
[info@edehr.org](mailto:info@edehr.org) for a personal demonstration or go to [https://edehr.org](https://edehr.org) and select the "Full EdEHR demonstration" button.  In this demonstration mode.
- You can mimic logging into a very simplistic learning management system (LMS).
- You can try out the role of student or instructor. (Try student first.)
- As a student you can 
  - select an activity from one of two courses: a nursing and a med lab course
  - explore the patient chart and add assessments or reports.
  - submit your work for an instructor to evaluate.
  - access your dashboard that lists all the courses and activities you've accessed.
- As an instructor you can
  - select an activity from one of two courses: a nursing and a med lab course
  - review and/or modify the activity title and description
  - explore the "Learning Object" (content) that is linked to the activity and 
  - get to the Case Study which provides the patient data that the student will work with
  - You can also access the activity's class list and review the students work. You can review the work in either the EHR/LIS application or in a condensed table view. Here you can provide guidance and/or grading directly to the students. 
- As an instructor you can also self promote yourself to be a content creator. This means you can
  - Create and/or edit the properties of all Learning Objects
  - Create and/or edit the properties of the Case Studies that are used by Learning Objects

## Using an EdEHR instance

There are two ways a learning institution can use the EdEHR project. 

**Option 1.** is to host the application yourself using the EdEHR project open source (free) license. Your IT department can learn how to set up this fairly typical web application that is relatively easy to run. 

**Option 2.** is to use the services provided by [https://edehr.org](https://edehr.org). This is the easiest way to bring EdEHR in healthcare education.

You can read more about these options here: [https://edehr.org/aboutSaaS](https://edehr.org/aboutSaaS)

## Getting Started 

1. Once you have your EdEHR instance available the next step is for the EdEHR administrator to help the LMS administrator to create a LTI connection tool for the EdEHR.  This is usually a simple task that produces a LMS connection tool that instructors can then use in any course. In Moodle this tool is called an "External Tool".  See [LMS admin guide](/lms-admin)

2. Then lead instructors can begin to base their healthcare course content inside a simulated EHR.  See the [course designer guide](/course-designer/).

3. Next students can learn their profession within a working EHR and submit their work for instructor comment and evaluation. See the [student guide](/student/).

4. Instructors can review the learner's work within the EdEHR and provide comments for evaluation and to educate the student. See the [instructor guide](/instructor/).
