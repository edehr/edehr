# Introduction to the EdEHR
The EdEHR (**Ed**ucational **E**lectronic **H**ealth **R**ecord) is a platform for educational healthcare programs to base their teaching within simulated electronic health record system.  Visit [https://edehr.org](https://edehr.org) to learn more about the benefits of using the EdEHR in your healthcare education.

The EdEHR is focused on the student experience.  It's a simulated EHR where each student has their own workspace separate from others. Instructors are able to both create course content (case studies) and review their student's work.

The EdEHR works with any learning management systems (LMS) that is LTI compliant.  For example, 
[Moodle](https://moodle.org/),
[Canvas](https://www.canvaslms.com/),
[Blackboard](https://www.blackboard.com), and
[D2L](https://www.d2l.com/).

Most users of the EdEHR are either students or instructors. All users access the EdEHR via their LMS. The LMS provides user authentication and authorization. Two other important roles are the EdEHR administrator and the education institution's LMS administrator.

## Getting Started - How to explore the EdEHR

There are three ways to explore what the EdEHR is.
1. Using the EHR only demonstration mode available from the home page,
2. Working with a full EdEHR demonstration mode available by request, or
3. With an instance of EdEHR in combination with an LMS

### EHR only demonstration mode

If you are curious and want to explore the EHR pages go to [https://edehr.org](https://edehr.org) and select the "EHR only demonstration button".  In this demonstration mode you can
- explore some sample case studies
- edit any case study (e.g. chart some medical assessment or otherwise use an EHR)
- save a copy of your edits (download)

### Full EdEHR demonstration

The full demonstration lets you try a complete LMS and EdEHR system. Contact
[info@edehr.org](mailto:info@edehr.org) for a personal demonstration. 

The Full Demo includes 
- Simulated log into a mock LMS as one of two instructor persona or three student persona
- LMS LTI activities
- Establishing connections between the LMS activity and an EdEHR Learning Object
- Class list management for instructors including how to review student's work and communicate with your students.
- Student interactions with the EHR. This is the same as the EHR only demonstration mentioned above plus, 
  - ability to submit completed work
  - add personal notes into a personal scratch pad
  - etc
- Instructors management of course content.  More about this below.

## Using an EdEHR instance

There are two ways a learning institution can use the EdEHR project. 

**Option 1.** is to host the application yourself using the EdEHR project open source (free) license. Your IT department can learn how to set up this fairly typical web application that is relatively easy to run. 

**Option 2.** is to use the services provided by [https://edehr.org](https://edehr.org). This is the easiest way to bring EdEHR in healthcare education.

You can read more about these options here: [https://edehr.org/aboutSaaS](https://edehr.org/aboutSaaS)

## Getting Started 

1. Once you have your EdEHR instance available the next step is for the EdEHR administrator to help the LMS administrator to create a LTI connection tool for the EdEHR.  This is a simple task that produces a tool that instructors can then use in any course. In Moodle this tool is called an "External Tool".  See [LMS admin guide](/lms-admin)

2. Then lead instructors can begin to base their healthcare course content inside a simulated EHR.  See the [course designer guide](/course-designer/).

3. Next students can learn their profession within a working EHR and submit their work for instructor comment and evaluation. See the [student guide](/student/).

4. Instructors can review the learner's work within the EdEHR and provide comments for evaluation and to educate the student. See the [instructor guide](/instructor/).
