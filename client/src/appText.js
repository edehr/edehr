It is an educational tool designed for medical education programs that seek a Canadian system that is focused on the student experience. EdEHR is suitable for all health care programs including, but not limited to, nursing, medicine, pharmacy, physiotherapy and more. EdEHR can be connected with many learning management systems including Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, and other <a href=\"https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability\">LTI</a> compliant learning systems. Each institution can customize the course content or seek ways to share resources with other institutions. EdEHR is an open source project.\n For more information jump to the <a href=\"#resources\">resources </a> section below.

    ' Then log in as an instructor and review the work your "students" have done.\n' +
    ' As an instructor you can also customize the learning objects and case study data. ' +
    ' To do this log in as an instructor and go to one of the assignments. ' +
    ' Then go to the Learning Objects tab and explore how you can modify the instructions given to the students. ' +
