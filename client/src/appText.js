It is an educational tool designed for medical education programs that seek a Canadian system that is focused on the student experience. EdEHR is suitable for all health care programs including, but not limited to, nursing, medicine, pharmacy, physiotherapy and more. EdEHR can be connected with many learning management systems including Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, and other <a href=\"https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability\">LTI</a> compliant learning systems. Each institution can customize the course content or seek ways to share resources with other institutions. EdEHR is an open source project.\n For more information jump to the <a href=\"#resources\">resources </a> section below.

  intro: 'Welcome to the Educational Electronic Health Record system demonstration log in page.  EdEHR helps in the education of our future health care workers, be they nurses, doctors, pharmacists, or other healthcare professions. EdEHR gives these students experience using an electronic health record system.\n This demonstration page let\'s you pretend to be an instructor or a student. Here you can "log in" as a user of a simulated learning management system (LMS) and through this get into the EdEHR. This simulated login will connect the same way other systems such as Canvas, Blackboard and Moodle will connect.',
  explanation:
'In real life your LMS administrator works with an administrator the EdEHR to create connections between the two' +
    ' systems. These connections are the learning objects that instructors can use within their courses.\n This' +
    ' demonstration will provide you with a one page LMS that has connections to the EdEHR that are ready to go.' +
    ' Once you "log in" you will see a fictitious course with sample assignments.\n You can "log in" as either an' +
    ' instructor or a student. Instructors can customize assignment content or evaluate the work of their students.' +
    ' (You will need to try out the student role before your instructor role will see students in the class list.)\n' +
    ' Students can complete assignments.\n We recommend you first log in as a student, try to follow the' +
    ' instructions set by your "instructor" and submit something for evaluation. You can then use the Demo menu item' +
    ' on the top banner to come back here and "log in" as an instructor. You can then go to "your" class list, see a list of "your" students and try out the evaluation experience.\n Once you are done with the basic flow of students working on the assignments and instructors evaluating the student\'s work then come back here and log in as an instructor and, this time, go to the assignments page and modify the instructions given to the students or go deeper and modify the EHR case study content.\n Use the Demo menu item on the top banner to change your persona or leave the demonstration.  When you leave the demonstration all of your demonstration data is reset.  Remember this instance of the EdEHR is a prototype and so the admin of this instance may need to reset the system at any time.',
