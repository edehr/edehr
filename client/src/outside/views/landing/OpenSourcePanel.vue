    h3 The EdEHR is open source
    p.
      "Open Source" means the application is freely available to everyone in the world to read
      and use, at no cost.  It's a completely transparent application.

    p.
      This means that any learning institution is free to help this project by funding development
      to add features and capabilities that they require. And when you do you will help everyone else.
      There are so many synergies to be gained when we work together across learning institution
      and across health care profession.

    p.
      Being open source means that anyone can run the application if they wish, although it
      is more cost effective to use the services of <a href="https://edehr.org">edehr.org</a>
