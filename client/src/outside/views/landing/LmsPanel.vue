    h3 Works with your learning management system
    p.
      The EdEHR works along side your learning management system (LMS). Whether you use Moodle, Canvas, D2L, or another
      LMS, the EdEHR starts and ends with your LMS.  We start by working with your LMS admin team to create
      what is called an LTI connector between the LMS and EdEHR. This one-time-only step then leads the way for
      instructors to create activities within your LMS that launch the user into the EdEHR.

    p.
      When students click the activity link they are taken into the EHR/LIS application and there they receive
      the medical context and complete their work.

    p.
      When instructors click the activity link they are taken into the LMS side of the EdEHR. Here they can see which
      students have started and/or completed and activity. Instructors can also view the students' work and provide
      evaluation comments for their learners. Instructors can also close the activity and prevent students from
      adding more content. Or they can reopen the activity and let individual students or the whole class continue
      adding content.
