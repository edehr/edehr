      There are several ways you can see a new feature added.  You can develop it yourself within the EdEHR
      open source project. Or you can fund the development through edehr.org. Or if the feature is something
      that only requires a small amount of effort and is something that can benefit all users then you can
      ask edehr.org to consider the request.
