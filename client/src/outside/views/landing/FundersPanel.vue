    p From 2018 to 2020, the
      strong  British Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training
      |  funded the initial EdEHR project through
      strong  BCcampus.
      |  This funding developed the open source EdEHR prototype which established the feasibility of the concept.  In March 2020, BcCampus funded the first prototype use of the EdEHR in a class at UBC School of Pharmacy.
    p Also in 2020, the
      strong  UBC Faculty of Medicine
      |  provided some funding to add the ability to insert external files into EHR records.
    p From 2020 until today,
      strong  BCIT
      |  has been the major contributor. Thanks to BCIT the EdEHR project is now a working and well used application.  Plus, BCIT has started the development of the Lab Information System inside the EdEHR.
    p.
      Also since 2020, edehr.org has made significant contributions to the open source EdEHR project.
