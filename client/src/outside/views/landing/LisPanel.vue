    h3 The EdEHR contains a fledgling yet proven Lab Information System
    p.
      The EdEHR is designed to support the education
      of health care professionals in a wide range of professions and we are now working to
      build out a Lab Information System layer.
    p.
      Currently we have a Hematology module yet we are working on Chemistry and Urinalysis
      and will then be considering other areas such as Histology and Microbiology.  Get involved
      now and be part of the design team.
    p.
      The EdEHR has a boring pedantic name
      but that suits its nature because its a tool that is focused first on the students' experience and
      then on the instructors' experience
    p.
      BCIT has funded and guided this work on the Med Lab.
      In their Med Lab department they were using an aging application for hematology lab,
      but it had lots of problems
      with no easy way to resolve them.  We chose to implement the Hematology Med Lab module inside
      the EdEHR so we could leverage the way the EdEHR helps both students and instructors.
    p.
      This past year, the hematology module was used during every lab class over
      two semesters and the student
      feedback has been very positive.
    p.
      Also during this past year the BCIT lab instructors provided guidance to the EdEHR developer
      and we made substantial improvements to enhance both the student and instructor experience.

    p.
      Eventually, we will evolve the application to present a more typical LIS experience.
      Plus, we're working towards adding more modules such as chemistry, histology, microbiology and more.
