    h3 The EdEHR contains a fledgling yet proven Lab Information System
    p.
      Thanks to BCIT, the EdEHR contains the beginnings of a Lab Information System (LIS). We started with the EdEHR because
      its more than just an educational electroning record system because it's designed to work with
      a learning management system and it presents itself in many ways like a lab information system.

    p.
      The EdEHR has a boring pedantic name
      but that suits its nature because its a tool that is focused first on the students' experience and
      then on the instructors' experience
    p.
      BCIT had an aging application they used for well over a decade in hematology lab. But it had lots of problems
      and no easy way to resolve them other than to write a new application.  Instead of starting
      completely from scratch we added a hematology module into the EdEHR.
    p.
      This past year, the hematology module was used during every lab class over two semesters and the student
      feedback has been very positive.
    p.
      Also during this past year the BCIT lab instructors provided guidance to the EdEHR developer
      and we made substantial improvements to enhance both the student and instructor experience.

    p.
      Eventually, we're going to hide the EHR parts of the application and present a more typical LIS experience.
      Plus, we're working towards adding more modules such as chemistry, histology, microbiology and more.
