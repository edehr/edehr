    h3 The EdEHR contains a fledgling yet proven Lab Information System
    p.
      The EdEHR is designed to support the education
      of health care professionals in a wide range of professions, including medical laboratory technologists and administrators.
      The application simulates a lab information system (LIS) in a way that supports educators and students.

    p.
      Currently we have a Hematology module and we will soon add the Urinalysis module. The chemistry forms
      are under development as are the forms to support accessioning.
    p.
      BCIT has funded and guided much of this work to support the med lab.
      The BCIT Hematology department was using an aging application for hematology lab that had lots of problems.
      They chose to help implement a Hematology Med Lab module inside
      the EdEHR and since September 2022 this module has been used by all lab classes with approximately 96 students per session.
      The student feedback has been very positive.
    p.
      Also during this past year the BCIT lab instructors provided guidance to the EdEHR developer
      and we made substantial improvements to enhance both the student and instructor experience.
      We are currently preparing to deliver Urinalysis into the classroom in the fall of 2023.
    p.
      Eventually, we will evolve the application to add more modules such as chemistry, histology, microbiology and more.
