    h3 The EdEHR contains a fledgling yet proven Lab Information System
    p.
      Thanks to BCIT, the EdEHR contains the beginnings of a fuller Lab Information System (LIS).  The EdEHR itself
      is an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system designed for healthcare education. It has a boring pedantic name
      yet that suits its nature because its a tool that is focused first on the students' experience and
      then on the instructors' experience
    p.
      In partnership with BCIT, the EdEHR project has been extended to include a Hematology Lab module. This is
      just the start for where it will go to support laboratory technologist learners.
      This past year, the hematology module was used during every lab class over two semesters.
    p.
      As well this year, the BCIT lab instructors provided guidance to the developer and we made substantial improvements
      to enhance both the student and instructor experience.
      Eventually, we're going to hide the EHR parts of the application and present a more typical LIS experience.
      Plus, we're working towards adding more modules such as chemistry, histology, microbiology and more.

    h3 The EdEHR adds realism and is learner centered
    p.
      Using the EdEHR in laboratory classes adds realism and bridges theory into practice.
      Using the EdEHR gives students the chance to develop competency with digital technology
      that mirrors practice.  Yet, is focused on the pedagogy first.

    h3 Works with your learning management system
    p.
      The EdEHR works along side your learning management system (LMS). Whether you use Moodle, Canvas, D2L, or another
      LMS, the EdEHR starts and ends with your LMS.  We start by working with your LMS admin team to create
      what is called an LTI connector between the LMS and EdEHR. This one-time-only step then leads the way for
      instructors to create activities within your LMS that launch the user into the EdEHR.

    p.
      When students click the activity link they are taken into the EHR/LIS application and there they receive
      the medical context and complete their work.

    p.
      When instructors click the activity link they are taken into the LMS side of the EdEHR. Here they can see which
      students have started and/or completed and activity. Instructors can also view the students' work and provide
      evaluation comments for their learners. Instructors can also close the activity and prevent students from
      adding more content. Or they can reopen the activity and let individual students or the whole class continue
      adding content.

    h3 Canadian
    p The EdEHR presents Canadian measurements and terms and procedures.

    p If you use the edehr.org SaaS then the servers are hosted in Canada.

    h3 Cost effective
    p.
      The EdEHR is open source so your school can dedicate IT staff to operating the application or
      or you can use the edehr.org SaaS for a fee that is much lower than other commercial (US) applications.
