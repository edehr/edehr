    h4 Its a fledgling yet proven Lab Information System
    p.
      The EdEHR contains the beginnings of a fuller Lab Information System (LIS).  The EdEHR itself
      is an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system designed for Education. It has a boring pedantic name
      yet that suits its nature because its a tool that is focused first on the student experience and
      next on the instructor.
    p.
      In partnership with BCIT, the EdEHR project has been extended to include a Hematology Lab module
      that has now been used for every lab class over two semesters.
    p.
      The lab instructors have provided guidance to the developer and we made substantial improvements
      and we plan so many more.  Essentially, we're working towards hiding the EHR parts of the application
      and presenting a more typical LIS experience. Plus, we're working towards adding; chemistry,
      histology, microbiology and more.
