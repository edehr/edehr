      There are many areas of this application that require further development. Learning institutions are
      encouraged to provide funding and/or development help to further enhance this application. Currently,
      seeking funding to ensure the application is fully accessible and meets accessibility requirements.
      And we're looking to improve the connection between the learning management system (LMS) and EdEHR
      to allow grades to be transferred from the EdEHR into the LMS.
