# About EDEHR
> Educational Electronic Health Record system: a [BCcampus](https://bccampus.ca) project

## Description

EdEHR is an open source web application developed to teach medical students how to use an EHR before they enter the workforce. It can be accessed only through a learning management system (LMS) and requires a technical person to set it up. Once set up, users can access the system either as an instructor or a student.
